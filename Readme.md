# Playalong

WORK IN PROGRESS

This is a tool that helps you to play along to songs on YouTube.
It allows you to define section in a song and loop them individually, until you figured that part of the song out.

## Building/Development
- Step 1: `npm install`: Install dependencies
- Step 2: Whichever you need of:
  - `npm run build`: Builds the app into the `dist/` directory
  - `npm run serve`: Opens the app in the default browser with (somewhat broken) hot reloading.
  - `npm run clean`: Removed `dist/` and `.cache/`. Sometimes necessary if stuff breaks in a strange way.
